# S4-Admin WordPress plugin

This is a fork of the mainwp-child plugin by MainWP, with changes made by us for installation and use on the sites of our hosting clients.

Changes are mostly branding, cosmetic, and removing options that are unnecessary for client sites.

## What it does?

We are using MainWP as a tool to let us monitor and update plugins, vulnerabilities, backups, etc. on all of the WordPress sites installed across our servers. It gives us the ability to do all of that without actually logging into clients sites.

This plugin is installed on each client site and allows them to connect to our MainWP Dashboard.

## Documentation

We install and setup this plugin on client sites, where there shouldn't be any need to change anything. If you have questions or need help contact S4 support. 

## Thanks to MainWP

MainWP is a great open source tool and this plugin is almost entirely thier work. Thanks to them for creating it and releasing under GPL.
